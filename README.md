**Charlie-River/Charlie-River** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- 🔭 I’m currently working on: a to-do list website (a classic I know).

- 🌱 I’m currently learning:
  + Web Development! I have the basics down but I am looking to incorporate some more frameworks.
  + Java, I'm trying to focus on nailing the data structures for this!
  + Currently trying to expand my portfolio as well :)
